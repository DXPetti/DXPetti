### Hello there 👋

I'm James Pettigrove, I'm a Solutions Engineer 👷‍ with a passion for Infrastructure and End User Compute. Predominately spend my days in the Microsoft stack but I'm not shy about Linux 🐧. When I'm not tinkering with Raspberry Pi's or Containers, I'm getting that much needed sunshine in the great outdoors 🌄

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Project Services for Federal Goverment customers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Cloud, leaning towards Azure and Kubernetes based designs
- 💬 Ask me about: Powershell, Containers or whatever your poison is. If I can help, I will!
- 📫 How to reach me: Mostly active on Twitter + LinkedIn
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've ran up the 88 levels of the Eureka Tower as part of the Eureka Climb 2013
